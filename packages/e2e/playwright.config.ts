/**
 * Playwright config. POM (`pages/`) + the Wave 7 bonus specs (`tests/`) drive
 * the app under a compressed time model so the 1-minute summary-email cadence
 * and the Fibonacci SMS gaps are observable in E2E (ADR-0004).
 *
 * Time-model tuning (Wave 7 — determinism, NOT assertion-weakening):
 *  - `TICK_MS=1000` (was 60). One simulated minute = 1 s. Root cause that
 *    drove this: the scheduler is a real `setInterval(tick, TICK_MS)` and a
 *    *summary email fires every simulated minute*. At 60 ms that is ~17
 *    `email.created` SSE frames/s; the client `liveReducer.upsert` re-sorts
 *    the whole (≤200-cap) emails feed and React re-renders every expandable
 *    `EmailCard` on each frame. Under the Next production server + headless
 *    Chromium that render churn progressively starved the page until even
 *    trivial locator queries timed out → intermittent failures (observed at
 *    60 ms AND at 200 ms = ~5 frames/s). 1000 ms cuts the dominant flood to
 *    ~1 frame/s — the page stays responsive for the whole run. The schedule
 *    is still fully observed: SMS land at cumulative sim-minutes 1,2,4,7,12
 *    → 1/2/4/7/12 s; the first summary email ≈ 1 s.
 *  - `FIBONACCI_RESET_MINUTES=20` / `EMAIL_RESET_MINUTES=20` (were 7). 20 ≥
 *    the 5th Fibonacci gap-sum (12) so a full natural sequence 1,2,4,7,12
 *    fires *before* the reset minute (20) restarts it — the reset/`fibCycle`
 *    is still reached and observable (ADR-0005), but the SMS rate is never
 *    starved to <3 sends while the task is pending. The task is necessarily
 *    added a few sim-minutes after the scheduler starts (it starts on the
 *    first SSE connect during page load), so the title-bearing reminders the
 *    spec asserts are the later sends in this/next cycle.
 *  - Assertions are UNCHANGED and strict (see specs): the budgets are wide
 *    web-first timeouts derived from the model — no hard sleeps, no weakened
 *    checks. Whole suite ≈ 30–40 s, comfortably deterministic.
 * Next.js does not override already-set process env, so these `webServer.env`
 * values win over `apps/web/.env` (ADR-0004 note).
