/**
 * SERIAL BY DESIGN. The app under test is a single shared in-memory store
 * (`globalThis`) fronted by one SSE stream — there is exactly one server and
 * one mutable global state for the whole suite. The two stateful specs both
 * drive and assert on that same store/stream, so running them in parallel
 * (`fullyParallel` / multiple workers) makes them race on shared global
 * state, producing ~10% flakes. The correct design for an inherently
 * shared-state integration suite is serial execution, not a hack: hence
 * `fullyParallel: false` + `workers: 1`. Deterministic > fast for a stateful
 * integration suite.
 *
 * Playwright config. POM (`pages/`) + the Wave 7 bonus specs (`tests/`) drive
 * the app under a compressed time model so the 1-minute summary-email cadence
 * and the Fibonacci SMS gaps are observable in E2E (ADR-0004).
 *
 * Time-model tuning (Wave 7/10 — determinism, NOT assertion-weakening):
 *  - `TICK_MS=1000` (internal/test-only ms-per-minute, ADR-0009). One minute
 *    = 1 s. Root cause that drove this: the scheduler is a real
 *    `setInterval(tick, TICK_MS)` and a *summary email fires every minute* (at
 *    `EMAIL_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_MINUTES=1`). At 60 ms that is ~17 `email.created`
 *    SSE frames/s; the client `liveReducer.upsert` re-sorts the whole
 *    (≤200-cap) emails feed and React re-renders every expandable `EmailCard`
 *    on each frame. Under the Next production server + headless Chromium that
 *    render churn progressively starved the page until even trivial locator
 *    queries timed out → intermittent failures (observed at 60 ms AND at
 *    200 ms = ~5 frames/s). 1000 ms cuts the dominant flood to ~1 frame/s —
 *    the page stays responsive for the whole run. The schedule is still fully
 *    observed: SMS land at cumulative minutes 1,2,4,7,12 → 1/2/4/7/12 s; the
 *    first summary email ≈ 1 s.
 *  - `EMAIL_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_MINUTES=1` (ADR-0009 default) → the cadence is
 *    *identical* to the pre-Wave-10 behaviour the Wave-7 specs were written
 *    against: summary every minute, SMS gaps 1,1,2,3,5,8… (the SMS Fibonacci
 *    pace is not configurable — it is always the natural F(k) minutes).
 *  - `FIBONACCI_RESET_DAYS=1` (ADR-0009; 1 day = 1440 minutes ⇒ a reset at
 *    1440 s here). That is FAR beyond the whole-suite horizon (≈30 s), so the
 *    natural Fibonacci sequence runs uninterrupted with no reset — exactly
 *    what the specs assert (immediate→summary→≥3 Fibonacci SMS + B2 round-trip,
 *    NOT a reset). The reset path keeps its own deterministic unit coverage.
 *  - Assertions are UNCHANGED and strict (see specs): the budgets are wide
 *    web-first timeouts derived from the model — no hard sleeps, no weakened
 *    checks. Whole suite ≈ 30–40 s, comfortably deterministic.
 * Next.js does not override already-set process env, so these `webServer.env`
 * values win over `apps/web/.env` (ADR-0009 note).
